## Overview

This is a simle example of fetching and processing data from a PLC structure variable, and subsequently transforming this data into a PDF document. The core functionality involves accessing a specific PLC variable via its name, attempting to apply the contents of this variable to a predefined template, and, upon successful integration, generating a PDF output.

npm install
```
## Usage

### Prepare the TwinCAT program
Make sure the TwinCAT runtime is installed and running. There's a TwinCAT example project included in the twincat folder of this project for your reference.

### Prepare the Template
There's a copy of template.json in the template folder. Make sure to use it as the template for creating your PDF.

### Run the program
The program takes the following arguments:

1. pdfPath : The path to the output PDF file.|
2. templatePath: the path to the JSON template file.
3. variable: the name of the PLC structure variable to read.
4. netId (optional): the ADS Net ID of the PLC, defaults to 127.0.0.1.1.1.
5. port (optional): the ADS port, defaults to 851.

You can run the program via npm:

Using full names
```bash
node app.js --pdfPath "C:/temp/myPdf.pdf" --templatePath "C:/temp/template.json" --variable "Main.myVariable" --address "127.0.0.1.1.1" --port 851
```
Using alias

```bash
node app.js -p "C:/temp/myPdf.pdf" -t "C:/temp/template.json" -v "Main.myVariable" -a "127.0.0.1.1.1" -r 851
```
